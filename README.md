# Introduction
Here are my solutions to problems from the [Rosalind platform](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/). The solutions are divided into groups according to the same principle as on the site. For convenience, the links of the solutions lead directly to the code from my repository. Click on the ID to view the problem condition.
